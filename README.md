# zoom-meetings-sms-blueprint
This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint explains how to set up Genesys Cloud and Zoom for agents to schedule a meeting with customers using Zoom. The agents can now directly schedule a Zoom meeting from Genesys Cloud. Genesys Cloud automatically sends an SMS message with the meeting URL to the customer and also opens the Zoom for the agent. The call can be either inbound or outbound as long it is in a queue.
